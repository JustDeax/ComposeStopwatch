## ðŸ”‘ APK Signature Key Change Notification
This notice is also available at: https://justdeax.github.io/ComposeStopwatch/key-rotation

Hello, I am the developer of this application.

Unfortunately, I **lost the signing key** used in previous versions of the app.  
As a result, updates signed with the new key **cannot be installed over existing installs**.  
To continue publishing updates, I have generated a **new signing key**.

**Application ID:** `com.justdeax.composeStopwatch`

**Old key (before 2025-05-01):**
```
SHA-256: a8:18:9a:88:76:f7:7c:c7:c1:c4:e9:1d:0f:75:30:5a:ba:36:98:8d:9a:48:91:f5:63:c4:a5:dd:a2:2b:70:33
```

**New key (since 2025-05-01):**
```
SHA-256: 6b:2a:b5:9a:56:7e:5e:05:d5:a3:d5:63:66:bd:5a:e0:d1:2a:11:ee:2e:10:46:d5:4d:14:9b:fa:53:43:d2:e0
```

I understand that losing a signing key compromises the trust chain.  
To address this:
- I remain in control of this repository and GitHub account
- I am open to further verification steps if required
- I have set up a persistent verification channel to avoid such issues in the future

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
